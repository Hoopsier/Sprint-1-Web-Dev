# 4. Product Backlog Review and Creation
# Product Backlog – Food E-commerce 

As the **Product Owner**, I ensured that a Product Backlog exists for the MERN-based Food E-commerce application. The Product Backlog has been created and maintained to provide a clear, prioritized view of all work required for the project.

The Product Backlog includes both **functional** and **technical requirements**, covering the full scope of the application. This includes:

- **Front-end requirements** such as React application setup, routing, and UI development aligned with the approved prototype  
- **Back-end requirements** including Express server configuration, REST API development, authentication, and MongoDB schema design  
- **AI-related items** such as initial AI endpoints and mock or placeholder recommendation logic  
- **Infrastructure-related items** including environment configuration, project structure, GitHub documentation, and deployment preparation  


## Sprint ceremonies' insights
"The ceremonies so far have been insightful. People are more likey to be caught unaware of something, resulting in others helping to fix that "bump on the road."" - Renan

### Daily Scrum

Daily Scrums helped the team stay aware of ongoing tasks and blockers, even when meetings were short or asynchronous. We noticed that regular check-ins improved transparency, but consistency needs improvement to fully benefit from this ceremony.

### Sprint Review

The Sprint Review allowed the team to reflect on what was completed and compare outcomes with the original Sprint Goal. Reviewing the prototype and backlog together helped align expectations and identify gaps early.

### Retrospective

The Retrospective encouraged honest reflection on teamwork, communication, and task distribution. Using the 4L method made it easier to express feedback and highlight areas for improvement in a structured way.

### More on Scrum

Overall, Scrum helped the team organize work incrementally and maintain focus on deliverables. We learned that clear roles, frequent communication, and realistic planning are essential for making Scrum effective in practice.

## Summary

The Sprint 2 Backlog was derived from the Product Backlog and aligned with Sprint 2 deliverables.All items are estimated using story points and assigned to responsible team members.  
This backlog ensures a strong technical foundation for future sprints.
