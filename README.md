# Sprint 2 Goal
By the end of Sprint 2, the team will deliver a working front-end and back-end structure aligned with the Sprint 1 prototype, including mock data, and initial AI-related endpoints.

# Product Backlog – Food E-commerce 


As the **Product Owner**, I ensured that a Product Backlog exists for the MERN-based Food E-commerce application. The Product Backlog has been created and maintained to provide a clear, prioritized view of all work required for the project.

The Product Backlog includes both **functional** and **technical requirements**, covering the full scope of the application. This includes:

- **Front-end requirements** such as React application setup, routing, and UI development aligned with the approved prototype  
- **Back-end requirements** including Express server configuration, REST API development, authentication, and MongoDB schema design  
- **AI-related items** such as initial AI endpoints and mock or placeholder recommendation logic  
- **Infrastructure-related items** including environment configuration, project structure, GitHub documentation, and deployment preparation
